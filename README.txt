Model:

* The pool creator specifies a `fee`, `feeInterval` and `waitPeriod`. So anybody
who joins might owe $50 once a month, or $20 every two weeks, or whatever. The
`waitPeriod` specifies how many `feeInterval`s a new member must make dues for
before they can make claims.

* If a user wants to leave the pool, they can do that at any time. Their total
ether input to-date is returned, minus any ether they took out. If a user lapses
on their fees, this happens automatically.

* To make a claim, a user submits a description of their tragedy and how much
ether they need to recover. The rest of the pool votes on whether to disburse
the funds (simple majority rules).

This doesnâ€™t scale past a relatively small group of friends, maybe a
neighborhood at max, but I think it could actually be quite cool for either of
those demographics.
